## Welcome
The OWASP® Somerset chapter seeks to bring an insightful approach to application security to Kentucky and the surrounding area. Through speakers, CTFs, mixers, and other events we hope to grow a thriving security community in the area.

## Call for Speakers

If you are interested in speaking at one of our meeting reach out to [Doyle](mailto:doyle.turner@owasp.org) or [Misty](mailto:mist.turner@owasp.org) to coordinate. We believe that everyone has something to contribute. If you have a topic of interest, but aren't sure about presenting reach out! We will do our best to help you pull together a presentation - or pair you with someone willing to present materials you develop together.

## Participation
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. 

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters Policy](/www-policy/operational/chapters). Financial contributions should only be made online using the authorized online donation button. 

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our [Projects](/projects/), [Local Chapters](/chapters/), [Events](/events/), [Online Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/), and [Community Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/). We especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as an expert. We also encourage you to be [become a member](/membership/) or consider a [donation](/donate/) to support our ongoing work.
